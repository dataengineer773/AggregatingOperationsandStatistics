We need to aggregate an operation over each column (or a set of columns) in a dataframe, Use the pandas agg method. Here, we can easily get the minimum value of every column Sometimes, we want to apply specific functions to specific sets of columns
We can also apply aggregate functions to groups to get more specific, descriptive statistics, Aggregate functions are especially useful during exploratory data analysis to learn information about different subpopulations of data and the relationship
between variables. By grouping the data applying aggregate statistics, you can view patterns in the data that may prove useful during the machine learning or feature engineering process. While visual charts are also
helpful, itâ€™s often helpful to have such specific, descriptive statistics as a reference to better understand the data.
